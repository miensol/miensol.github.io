I help teams build large scale, highly available and performant distributed systems that meet
demands of modern enterprises.

I believe close collaboration and highly engaged team is a key to top-notch products.

In my 10+ years of professional experienced I gained a vast and deep technical experience ranging
from low level programming to system architecture. I know intricacies of mobile application
development as well as distributed backend, services based systems.

I have a proven track record of leading teams to deliver high quality products that customers love
using lean and agile methodologies.
